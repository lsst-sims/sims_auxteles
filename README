Simulation of the LSST Auxiliary Telescope

Executable file: AuxSpecGen.py
Main dependences : scientific libraries for python, scipy, numpy

Inputs: 1D star spectrum, 1D atmosphere spectrum
Output: 1D spectrum obtained taking into account responses of all the optical elements of the AT.

input star spectrum can be given in dE/dl, dE/dn as a function of lambda or nu, use the appropriate function to read it.

output spectrum is given is photo-electrons, you can use the calibration function to get it in dE/dl using known responses of the AT (not very realistic!).

Arbitrary parameters (gain, exposure time, effective area) can be tuned giving them as input parameters to functions at differents step of the procedure.
